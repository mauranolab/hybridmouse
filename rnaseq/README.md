# rnaseq

This repository documents the RNA-seq STAR/RSEM processing pipeline used in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.175422v1):

* The base STAR/RSEM code is based on an older version of [the stampipes pipeline](https://github.com/StamLab/stampipes), and follows its directory structure.
* The allele-specific expression analysis (makeRNAcounts.sh) relies on countReads.py in the dnase project of this repository.
